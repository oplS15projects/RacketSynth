# RacketSynth

Easy to use synthesizer for Racket

RacketSynth is a module for Racket that creates an easy to use interface for creating sound using the Rsound and Racket GUI
libraries. It accomplishes this by wrapping the complicated Rsound function with an easy to use GUI. The current version of Milestone_v3.rkt relies on having a folder called images containing the relevant images as a sub-folder in the directory that contains the RacketSynth program.

##Assessment 

###From our feasbility report:

"The final version of our project will, ideally, have an interface for creating various types of sound waves at selected frequencies. These could be sine, sawtooth, square, or pulse waves. The frequencies will have reasonable upper and lower limits in order to protect the user's audio hardware and their ears. If we have time, we would like to add the layering of multiple sounds and different values. Theoretically, these layers could be used to synthesize any sound.

We will also create a way for the frequencies to be set by mapping keyboard inputs to particular values. This will allow a user to use their computer's keyboard as a playable instrument.

We will show all of the working freatures in our final demonstration."

###Accomplishments

Every single one of the above goals has been met. 

Users can easily create sound waves of any of the 4 mentioned types at whatever frequency they choose, within reasonable limits. Sounds can be layered. Currently we allow for 7 simultaneous sounds to be played and stacked. However, this limit of 7 sounds was chosen arbitrarily and we can easily increase this limit or remove it all together. This was simply added to prevent a user from purposley breaking the program. 

Users can also use their computer's keyboard to generate sounds. When keyboard-input is selected a non-functional map is shown to the user that shows the musical notes that are played by particular keys. 

Each of these features were successfully demostrated and users were able to quickly and easily generate sounds. 

###Evaluation of Results and Analysis
![A summary of our results:](http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/results_table_zpsvjyklwjn.png)


Although our sample size is too small  to be statistically significant for extrapolating to a larger population with mathematical assurance (N = 8), it does provide anecdotal evidence for a favorable reception to the product.  On a scale of “one” to “ten” with one being “very poor” and ten meaning “excellent”, we achieved at least one rating as excellent for each of the four categories and received a rating no lower than 8 in any of the categories.  In three of the four categories assessed, the averages were closer to 10 than to 8, more specifically in functionality (9.38), ease of use (9.25), and overall quality of product (9.38). User interface design had the lowest average score at 8.75, which is still quite strong.  The category with the largest standard deviation, which indicates the most common discrepancy in opinion among our respondents, was ease of use at (σ = .83). The category with the lowest standard deviation was overall quality of product (σ = .48). This piece of information combined with the average score of 9.38 indicates that our respondents felt that the overall quality of the product was near excellent with very little variation.
