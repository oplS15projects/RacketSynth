Easy to use synthesizer for Racket

RacketSynth is a module for Racket that creates an easy to use interface for creating sound using the Rsound and Racket GUI
libraries. It accomplishes this by wrapping the complicated Rsound function with an easy to use GUI. The current version of Milestone2_gui_needs_merging.rkt relies on having a folder called images containing the relevant images as a sub-folder in the directory that contains the RacketSynth program.
