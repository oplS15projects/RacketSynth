<p>RacketSynth is a module for Racket that creates an easy to use interface for creating sound using the Rsound and Racket GUI
libraries. It accomplishes this by wrapping the complicated Rsound function with an easy to use GUI. </p>

<p>Below is a screenshot of the GUI interface of Racket as of Sunday, April 26th 2015</p>

<a id="concepts-demonstrated" class="anchor" href="#concepts-demonstrated" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Concepts Demonstrated</strong>
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Expressiveness</strong> is utilized in creating sounds with different waves forms. We have taken the RSound library procedures and simplified them, making the code more expressive and easier to understand.</li>
<li>We have built an <strong>abstraction barrier</strong> between the user and the underlying
implementation, allowing for ease-of-use by someone unfamiliar with coding.</li>
<li> <strong>Symbolic data</strong> was referenced and used in the respective lists for the style property of GUI elements.</li>
</ul>

</h2>

<p>We used the library Rsound, which can be downloaded via the package manager inside Dr.Racket
/(provide screenshot of package manager open). Rsound allowed for playing We also used the GUI toolkit that's documentation
is available <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/index.html">here</a>, incorporating objects such as GUI message
objects, radio boxes, button events wrapped in a lambda, panels, and more.  was used 
to test with function definitions contained in a separate file. </p>

<p>ImageMagik was used in a Lubuntu environment to edit images that came from <a href="https://openclipart.org">openclipart.org</a>.
MS Paint was used to edit the screenshots used in this website.</p>

<a id="our-favorite-lines-of-code" class="anchor" href="#our-favorite-lines-of-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Our Favorite Lines of Code</strong>
</h2>

<h3>
<a id="davids-favorite" class="anchor" href="#davids-favorite" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>David's Favorite</h3>

<p><code>[callback (lambda (text event)
                              (begin (keySound (myGetText keyInput))
                                          (send keyInput set-value "")))]</code></p>

<p>This is a callback that is placed inside of a text field used to listen for keyboard input. The first part of the callback grabs the current content of the text-field and sends it to the 'keySound' procedure, which uses the input to generate sounds. The next line then sets the content of the text-field to be an empty string, effectively clearing it out. This prevents previous inputs from being perpetuated and keeps each keystroke isolated.</p>

<h3>
<a id="stevens-favorite" class="anchor" href="#stevens-favorite" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Steven's Favorite</h3>

<p><code>(if(equal? "Notes" (radio-check freq-box))
                       (play-Note (radio-check note-box) 1 2)
                       (my-play (string-&gt;number (myGetText freq-field)) .5 2)))]))</code></p>

<p>This is the line of code that determines what kind of sounds is played. If the play note box is checked, then it will play the desired note. If it's not checked, it defaults to playing the frequency that the user inputted into the text box. The parameters .5 and 2 are used as default volume and note durations respectively, though currently notes sustain indefinitely</p>

<h3>
<a id="kevins-favorite" class="anchor" href="#kevins-favorite" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Kevin's Favorite</h3>

<p>One of my favorites did not make the cut for presentation time.</p>

<p><code>(define my-play-bitmap-1 (read-bitmap "./images/play_icon3.png"))
(define playSound (new button% (parent buttonPanel (label my-play-bitmap-1))))</code></p>

<p>It takes a PNG file, reads it in using the read-bitmap function, and then it is used later as a label to a button.
However, this was not implemented in the current product.</p>

<a id="how-to-download-and-run" class="anchor" href="#how-to-download-and-run" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>How to Download and Run</strong>
</h2>

<p>Click <a href="https://github.com/oplS15projects/RacketSynth/zipball/master">here</a> to download the current version of RacketSynth.  RacketSynth depends upon racket 6.1.1, which can be downloaded <a href="http://download.racket-lang.org/">here</a> and on an environment such as DrRacket, which comes with the download. </p>

<p>To unzip RacketSynth after you have downloaded it, first go to its containing folder either by navigating through your file directories you saved it in on a Linux system or by navigating to your "Downloads" folder if you are on a Windows system.</p>

<p><img src="http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/windows_RS_DL_zpsjtsq0tav.png" alt="Downloads folder a on Windows 7 System"></p>

<p>You can open the file RacketSynth.rkt directly if DrRacket is your default application for dealing Racket code by going to the File menu, clicking "Open" then navigating and selecting RacketSynth.rkt .</p>

<p><img src="http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/click_file_options_v1.2_zpsgl8keugc.png" alt="Selecting File in DrRacket">
Once DrRacket is opened, click "File" in the upper-right-hand corner of the screen then click on the selection "Package Manager..." from the pull-down menu.</p>

<p><img src="http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/package_manager_DrRacket_click_to_update_scaled_v1.1_zpsifn5sid9.png" alt="Click to Update Rsound"></p>

<p>Type in rsound into the textbox labeled "Package Source", then click the button "Update" to the right and below.</p>

<p>Once Rsound is installed, navigate back to the main menu and click the "Run" button.</p>

<p><img src="http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/run_button_v1.3_zpskbjhmi0v.png" alt="Run Button"></p>

<p>You can then select notes of different pitches and press the play button. You can also type in a frequency and produce a note at that pitch. If you want to disable the sound, you can hit the stop button.  You can also generate sound that follows a wave-like distribution for the sine wave. Enabling keyboard input allows Racketsynth to detect and interpret keystrokes in order to play sounds. Use the center row of keys, from 'A' to 'K' to play an A major scale. Currently, only one note may be played at a time. A note will sustain until the next note is played. Pressing the space bar will stop the current note.  Once you are finished with the program, you can click the <strong>X</strong> in the upper-right-hand corner to exit the program.</p>
