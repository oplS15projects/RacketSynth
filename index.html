<p>RacketSynth is a module for Racket that creates an easy to use interface for creating sound using the Rsound and Racket GUI
libraries. It accomplishes this by wrapping the complicated Rsound function with an easy to use GUI. </p>

<p>Below is a screenshot of the GUI interface of Racket as of Sunday, April 26th 2015</p>

</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Expressiveness</strong> is utilized in creating sounds with different waves forms.</li>
<li>We have built an <strong>abstraction barrier</strong> between the user and the underlying
implementation, allowing for ease-of-use by someone unfamiliar with coding.</li>
<li> <strong>Symbolic data</strong> was referenced and used in the respective lists for the style property of GUI elements.</li>
</ul>

</h2>

<p>We used the library Rsound, which can be downloaded via the package manager inside Dr.Racket
/(provide screenshot of package manager open). Rsound allowed for playing We also used the GUI toolkit that's documentation
is available <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/index.html">here</a>, incorporating objects such as GUI message
objects, radio boxes, button events wrapped in a lambda, panels, and more.  was used 
(presumably) to test with function definitions contained in a separate file. </p>

<p>(CL) The racket library <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/plot/index.html">plot</a> was used to create a sawtooth graph, which could be used as a label.
(CL) ImageMagik was used in a Lubuntu environment to edit images that came from <a href="https://openclipart.org">openclipart.org</a>.</p>

<p><code>[callback (lambda (text event)
                              (begin (keySound (myGetText keyInput))
                                          (send keyInput set-value "")))]</code></p>

<p>This is a callback that is placed inside of a text field used to listen for keyboard input. The first part of the callback grabs the current content of the text-field and sends it to the 'keySound' procedure, which uses the input to generate sounds. The next line then sets the content of the text-field to be an empty string, effectively clearing it out. This prevents previous inputs from being perpetuated and keeps each keystroke isolated.</p>

<a id="how-to-download-and-run" class="anchor" href="#how-to-download-and-run" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>How to Download and Run</strong>
</h2>

<p>Click <a href="https://github.com/oplS15projects/RacketSynth/zipball/master">here</a> to download the current version of RacketSynth.  RacketSynth depends upon racket 6.1.1, which can be downloaded <a href="http://download.racket-lang.org/">here</a> and environment such as DrRacket, which I think comes with the download. 
(SN) Where does DrRacket come from again?</p>

<p>Unzip RacketSynth.</p>

<p>(CL) We may have a version of RacketSynth that relies on having a folder called images containing the relevant images as a sub-folder in the directory that contains the RacketSynth program.</p>

<p>(CL) Then do you also have to unzip images subfolder in there? Depends on final way of storing it.
You can either open the file (CL: What will be the name of the final file) directly if DrRacket is your default application for dealing Racket code, which has the terminal file extension .rkt 
(SF) If time permits, put screen shot of selection here.</p>

<p><img src="http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/click_file_options_v1.2_zpsgl8keugc.png" alt="Selecting File in DrRacket">
Once DrRacket is opened, click "File" in the upper-right-hand corner of the screen then click on the selection "Package Manager..." from the pull-down menu.</p>

<p><img src="http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/package_manager_DrRacket_click_to_update_scaled_v1.1_zpsifn5sid9.png" alt="Click to Update Rsound"></p>

<p>Type in rsound into the textbox labeled "Package Source", then click the button "Update" to the right and below.</p>

<p>Once Rsound is installed, navigate back to the main menu and click the "Run" button.</p>

<p><img src="http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/run_button_v1.3_zpskbjhmi0v.png" alt="Run Button"></p>

<p>You can then select notes of different pitches and press the play button. You can also type in a frequency and produce a note at that pitch. If you want to disable the sound, you can hit the stop button.  You can also generate sound that follows a wave-like distribution for the sine wave. Once you are finished with the program, you can click the <strong>X</strong> in the upper-right-hand corner to exit the program.</p>
