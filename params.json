It accomplishes this by wrapping the complicated Rsound function with an easy to use GUI. \r\n\r\nBelow is a screenshot of the GUI interface of Racket as of Sunday, April 26th 2015\r\n\r\n![RacketSynth GUI](http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/racketsynth_gui_v1.0_zps7lr9lxba.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Concepts Demonstrated**\r\n\r\n* **Expressiveness** is utilized in creating sounds with different waves forms.\r\n* We have built an **abstraction barrier** between the user and the underlying\r\nimplementation, allowing for ease-of-use by someone unfamiliar with coding.\r\n*  **Symbolic data** was referenced and used in the respective lists for the style property of GUI elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **External Technology and Libraries**\r\nWe used the library Rsound, which can be downloaded via the package manager inside Dr.Racket\r\n/(provide screenshot of package manager open). Rsound allowed for playing We also used the GUI toolkit that's documentation\r\nis available [here](http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/index.html), incorporating objects such as GUI message\r\nobjects, radio boxes, button events wrapped in a lambda, panels, and more. <racket/include> was used \r\n(presumably) to test with function definitions contained in a separate file. \r\n\r\n\\(CL\\) The racket library [plot](http://docs.racket-lang.org/plot/index.html) was used to create a sawtooth graph, which could be used as a label.\r\n\\(CL\\) ImageMagik was used in a Lubuntu environment to edit images that came from [openclipart.org](https://openclipart.org).\r\n\r\n## **Our Favorite Lines of Code**\r\n### David's Favorite\r\n\r\n`[callback (lambda (text event)\r\n                              (begin (keySound (myGetText keyInput))\r\n                                          (send keyInput set-value \"\")))]`\r\n     \r\nThis is a callback that is placed inside of a text field used to listen for keyboard input. The first part of the callback grabs the current content of the text-field and sends it to the 'keySound' procedure, which uses the input to generate sounds. The next line then sets the content of the text-field to be an empty string, effectively clearing it out. This prevents previous inputs from being perpetuated and keeps each keystroke isolated.\r\n### Steven's Favorite\r\n\r\n`(if(equal? \"Notes\" (radio-check freq-box))\r\n                       (play-Note (radio-check note-box) 1 2)\r\n                       (my-play (string->number (myGetText freq-field)) .5 2)))]))`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the line of code that determines what kind of sounds is played. If the play note box is checked, then it will play the desired note. If it's not checked, it defaults to playing  the frequency that the user inputted into the text box.\r\n\r\n### Kevin's Favorite\r\n\\(SN\\) RL\r\n\r\n#\r\n## **How to Download and Run**\r\n\r\nClick [here](https://github.com/oplS15projects/RacketSynth/zipball/master) to download the current version of RacketSynth.  RacketSynth depends upon racket 6.1.1, which can be downloaded [here](http://download.racket-lang.org/) and on an environment such as DrRacket, which comes with the download. \r\n\r\nTo unzip RacketSynth after you have downloaded it, first go to its containing folder either by navigating through your file directories you saved it in on a Linux system or by navigating to your \"Downloads\" folder if you are on a Windows system.\r\n\r\n![Downloads folder a on Windows 7 System](http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/windows_RS_DL_zpsjtsq0tav.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(CL\\) We may have a version of RacketSynth that relies on having a folder called images containing the relevant images as a sub-folder in the directory that contains the RacketSynth program.\r\n\r\n\\(CL\\) Then do you also have to unzip images subfolder in there? Depends on final way of storing it.\r\nYou can either open the file \\(CL: What will be the name of the final file\\) directly if DrRacket is your default application for dealing Racket code, which has the terminal file extension .rkt \r\n\\(SF\\) If time permits, put screen shot of selection here.\r\n\r\n![Selecting File in DrRacket](http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/click_file_options_v1.2_zpsgl8keugc.png)\r\nOnce DrRacket is opened, click \"File\" in the upper-right-hand corner of the screen then click on the selection \"Package Manager...\" from the pull-down menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Click to Update Rsound](http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/package_manager_DrRacket_click_to_update_scaled_v1.1_zpsifn5sid9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nType in rsound into the textbox labeled \"Package Source\", then click the button \"Update\" to the right and below.\r\n\r\nOnce Rsound is installed, navigate back to the main menu and click the \"Run\" button.\r\n\r\n![Run Button](http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm177/kevinseeker10/run_button_v1.3_zpskbjhmi0v.png)\r\n\r\nYou can then select notes of different pitches and press the play button. You can also type in a frequency and produce a note at that pitch. If you want to disable the sound, you can hit the stop button.  You can also generate sound that follows a wave-like distribution for the sine wave. Once you are finished with the program, you can click the **X** in the upper-right-hand corner to exit the program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
